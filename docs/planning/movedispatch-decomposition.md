# What the god-objects branch has not fixed

The branch decomposed the god files and directories. 27 packages came out of `nodes/Wiring`,
no file anywhere is over 391 lines, and no directory outside `nodes/Wiring` is over ~31 files.
This is the remaining list. Delete this doc when it is empty.

## 1. `loadspec` never lifted — unfinished, not blocked

`topo_spec.go`, `validate.go`, `loader_tree.go`, `node_registry.go`, `builders.go` are still
in `nodes/Wiring`. Every edge cleared except one: `loader_tree.go` reads `positionFileJSON`
(a 10-field JSON DTO, `quant_offset_persist.go:86`) and `positionFilePath` (one
`filepath.Join`, `node_mover.go:37`).

Move both into `nodes/Wiring/positionfile`, update writer and reader, re-attempt the lift.
`check-persist-write-ownership.sh` and `check-scene-path-resolution.sh` police these paths and
may match by unexported name — they go silently green once the symbols are exported, so fix
and prove teeth.

It was previously recorded as blocked on the reasoning that `persistence-ownership.md`
co-locates a file's reader and writer to stop schema drift. That rule governs write
ownership, not where a type lives. A schema in its own package that both sides import
prevents drift better than proximity.

## 2. `MoveDispatch` is still 63 methods across 20 files (was 88)

Its state is already twelve named owners; the facade over them was never fully decomposed.
The 13 generated pure delegators are done: `overlayToggles` now binds
`(*overlayState).ToggleX` directly (`tools/gen-node-defs/overlay_gen.go`'s `writeOverlayGen`,
`nodes/Wiring/overlay_gen.go`), `stdin_dispatch.go`'s `"toggle"` handler calls
`fn(&md.ui.ov, tr)`, and the scenePoles/nodePoles debug breadcrumb (the one non-pure part of
those 13 — it needed `md.EmitBreadcrumb`, a `MoveDispatch` method) moved to that same call
site via two small generated tables, `overlayFlagBreadcrumbScope` and `overlayFlagValue`.
88 → 75 methods (the drop is exactly 13).

Round 2 deleted the 15 remaining one-line pure forwards to a single owner field: `Bind`,
`EdgeOut`, `centerOfNode`, `enqueueFor`, `finalizeActors` (→ `md.mr`); `RootMove`,
`commitNodeMoveLocal`, `heldCenters` (→ `md.lq`); `setHoverUI` (→ `md.ui`); `NodeSeeds`,
`EdgeSeeds`, `loadTimeCenters` (→ `md.GS`, already exported — external callers in
`runtopology` now call `md.GS.NodeSeedsFn()`/`md.GS.EdgeSeedsFn()` directly, no new export).
Callers now address the owner field directly (`md.mr.X`, `md.lq.X(md, ...)`, `md.ui.X`).
`EdgeOut`'s own body (`mr.edgeOutFor`) turned out to have zero live callers anywhere — it
was deleted too as dead code once the delegator was gone (staticcheck U1000 caught it).

Three of the 15 turned out NOT to be pure/single-owner and were excluded, kept as-is:
`SliderSpeed` (`ui`) computes `EffectiveClockSpeed(md.ui.speed, md.ui.clockDivisor)` — a
derived value from two fields via a package function, not a plain forward. `SetViewpoint`
and `Viewpoint` (`ui`) both have OUT-OF-PACKAGE callers that cannot reach the unexported
`md.ui.vp` field directly — `runtopology.loadSceneState` passes `md.SetViewpoint` as a func
value to `scenecamera.SeedInitialViewpoint`, and `nodes/Wiring/scenecamera`'s own tests call
`md.Viewpoint()`. Deleting either would force exporting `ui`/`vp`, which the branch's own
constraint rules out.

75 → 63 methods (drop of 12, `grep -h "^func ([a-z]* \*MoveDispatch)"
nodes/Wiring/*.go | grep -v _test | wc -l`). Exported-symbol count for package `Wiring`
dropped 119 → 114 (no new exports).

Remaining, unstarted: ~43 single-owner methods remain to rehome (mostly `ui`, plus a few
`RT`/`Scenes`/`sw`/`inboxes`), the same mechanical shape as this round. 12 span two or more
owners; the dominant shape among them is *mutate state, then emit a view frame*, 8 times.

Order: rehome the remaining single-owner methods, then answer the write-then-emit question
once. Do not answer it by giving owners a back-reference to the hub — that is the cycle
returning under a new name.

`moverRegistry` is not a target. It owns `nodeMover`/`edgeMover`/`nodeGeometry`, the actors
MODEL.md pins, and whatever remains of `MoveDispatch` stays with it.

## 3. `buildCtx` is a 26-field shared mutable blackboard

11 build phases read and write it; no signature says what any phase reads or produces. Same
defect as `pb.md` and `currentBuildMD` — reaching for state instead of being handed it — and
the reason the build files cannot leave `Wiring`.

Fix: each phase takes what it reads and returns what it produces, so ordering is data flow
the compiler enforces. Do NOT do this with a registry: node kinds self-register because they
are an open set of independent things; the phases are a closed ordered sequence, and
registering them would need priority numbers or a dependency DAG — more machinery for eleven
known steps.

## 4. ~3½ build phases recompute what the movers already derive

One coordinate system: MODEL.md — *"a centre is a sum of polar vectors from ONE centre… every
node hangs off the scene centre directly, one hop."* `nodegeom.EdgeStepCount` is called from
`build_wires.go:45` at build and from `chain_beads.go:154` and
`beadcrud/touching_beads.go:95` at runtime — same function, same frame, same inputs.
`computeNodeGeometry`, `computeQuantizedLayout`, `computeReachRadii` are the same shape.

The structural phases are genuinely one-time (you cannot bind a channel that does not exist).
The derived-geometry ones need not exist: if a node derives its geometry from its position and
the scene sphere, as it already does at runtime, construction is the first update and those
phases delete rather than move. Worth more than item 3, and item 3 does not block it.

## The one rule

**Name the specific values the leaf reads from the hub.** If you can list them, it is not a
blocker — pass them and continue. Only if the leaf needs the hub *to drive it* is it real, and
then quote the compiler error verbatim.

`beadcrud` and `portwiring` were each declared genuine compiler-confirmed cycles by two
separate passes. Both lifted once someone asked that question. Every blocker on this branch
has been the same category, and it is indistinguishable from an impossibility at the compiler.

Be suspicious of a blocker justified by architectural prose citing a rule that does not cover
the case, offered in place of an error message. Prefer the compiler.

The same test catches a bad FIX, not just a bad blocker: when something is introduced as
unavoidable, name the alternative that was rejected and why. `currentBuildMD` was justified by
"`PortBindings` can no longer carry this" — true, and it says nothing about `BuildArgs`, which
was sitting next to it in the same package with ten fields already on it. `loadspec` was
justified by a persistence rule that governs a different thing. Both justifications were
locally true statements that did not reach the conclusion drawn from them.

## Constraints

- No interfaces, no `types`/`common` package, no alias shims, no dot-imports, no new
  package-level actor globals, no new `ForTest` hatches — enforced by
  `tools/network/structure/check-fortest-has-no-production-caller.sh`, empty allowlist. All
  of these make the compiler stop complaining while leaving the coupling in the design.
- No package under `nodes/Wiring/` may import `nodes/Wiring`. Verify across EVERY subpackage,
  not just the one being moved — scoping this check to the current change is how
  `stdinreader`/`scenecamera`'s two violations survived while the invariant was repeatedly
  reported as held. (Both are now fixed; the invariant holds across every subpackage.)
- No behaviour change: ownership, goroutine structure, channel wiring and timing are fixed.
- **The tests cannot prove no-behaviour-change.** `docs/process/testing-shape.md` forbids
  cross-goroutine tests, so nothing asserts the movers still coordinate. Drive the editor.
- Guards go silently green two ways: a non-recursive glob stops seeing moved files, and a
  guard keyed to an unexported name stops matching once exported. For any guard touched, make
  it fail once on purpose and record the text.
- If the exported surface grows, the change is not paying for itself — that is what happened
  to the late package-lifts, which is why this list stops at decomposition rather than
  continuing to lift.
